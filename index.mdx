Hiring shouldn‚Äôt feel like pushing a boulder uphill‚Äîyet in reality, it often does. Candidates get lost in spreadsheets, inboxes overflow, and your ATS is a dusty vault of forgotten applicants.

Kello flips that script.

This guide introduces you to the core Kello features and integrations designed to help you _rediscover_, _evaluate_, and _manage_ talent‚Äîall from one intelligent hub.

## What You‚Äôll Learn

### 1. Find & Re-engage Talent with the Talent Pool

- Dump the ‚Äúfresh start‚Äù hiring cycle. Kello automatically builds a centralized, dynamic database of past applicants, referrals, and inbound contacts‚Äîkeeping profiles up-to-date.
- Search fast, reuse warm pipelines, and revive candidates who made it far previously.
- Access is secure and permissioned based on your ATS or team structure.

### 2. Get Hiring Insights with Job Analytics

- No analytic degree required. Visual dashboards show you funnel health, top-performing sources, candidate makeup, and quality signals (skills coverage, tenure, etc.).
- Use pass-through rates, conversion graphs, and stage velocity to spot bottlenecks and optimize sourcing

### 3. Evaluate Engineers with Code Sight

- Skip take-home tests. Code Sight scans public GitHub repos to extract meaningful code quality signals‚Äîtech stack, hygiene, test habits, security, maintainability.
- Compare projects using plain-English summaries and pass/fail quality gates.

### 4. Find People, Fast with Kello Search

- Say goodbye to keyword chases. Use plain-English queries like ‚Äúfrontend, 4‚Äì6‚ÄØyrs, React, startup, unseen.‚Äù
- AI-powered search understands meaning, ranks results, highlights matching criteria, and lets you save/reuse prompts.
- Combines with filters and scopes (job or full pool) for supercharged triaging.

## Make it yours with integrations

- You control visibility and can disconnect anytime.

### Google Forms

### ATS (Lever, Greenhouse, Freshteams‚Ä¶)  

- Connect your ATS to unlock real historical data and centralized workflows. 
- Kello mirrors permissions, syncs pipeline progress, and injects searchable intelligence into your existing system.

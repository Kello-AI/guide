We’ve all been there. A new role opens up, and we kick off the same old grind: write the JD, post the job, wait for applicants, start sourcing cold. Meanwhile, your inbox, ATS, and Slack are full of people who’ve already raised their hand in the past — applied, got referred, or cold-reached someone on your team.

That’s your **Talent Pool** — and until now, it’s been hiding in plain sight.

## What's the problem?

Every job opening leads to a full restart. Even if you’ve had 300 great candidates apply for similar roles in the past, those folks are forgotten. Why? Because they’re buried in outdated spreadsheets, old inbox threads, or lost in the depths of your ATS. And even if you _could_ dig them up — would their profiles still be relevant?

It’s a huge missed opportunity, and frankly, a waste of everyone's time.

## Meet your Talent Pool 👋

Kello automatically creates a **centralized, searchable, and always up-to-date Talent Pool** from:

- Candidates who applied to any job at your company
- Cold inbound candidates who reached out to someone on your team
- Referrals submitted by employees (including ones that didn’t get hired yet)

Together, they form your **company-wide candidate graph** — searchable, filterable, and full of signal.

No more starting from scratch. You now have a warm pipeline of folks who already showed interest in working with you.

## So what’s different now?

Two words: **access** and **searchability**.

- You can now search your entire candidate history instantly — no need to dig through multiple tools or ping coworkers for old resumes.
- **Every candidate profile is kept fresh**. We auto-update work experience, current company, and role — even if they applied two years ago.
- You get full application history per candidate — every job they applied to, what stage they reached, and who spoke to them.

And yes, everything is **de-duplicated and unified**, so you’re always seeing a clean, complete view.

## How to use the Talent Pool effectively

Here’s how recruiters and hiring managers are already using it:

### 1. Find candidates worth reaching out to

Use powerful filters to surface high-signal candidates:

- **Most Advanced Stage** – Find candidates who made it to late-stage interviews previously (even if they weren’t hired).
- **Sourced By** – Filter for candidates _you_ or a teammate previously sourced.
- **Jobs Applied To** – Narrow down folks who applied to similar roles in the past.

Combine this with Kello’s AI-powered search and filtering to slice the pool however you want — "Product Designers in Berlin who made it to onsite for previous design roles"? Easy.

### 2. Add top matches to a Job or a Collection

Found someone promising? Add them directly to a new Job you’re hiring for, or group them into a **Collection** to share with the team for review.

This is especially useful when you want to get quick feedback before deciding to re-engage.

### 3. Trust the data (it’s fresh)

We keep every profile updated — current role, company, and more — so when you resurface someone, you’re seeing them as they are _today_, not how they were when they first applied.

## Access control that actually respects your org setup

Talent data is sensitive. We get that.

That’s why access to the Talent Pool is **fully governed** by your organization’s settings:

- Team members only see candidates from jobs they have access to.
- Shared inboxes or talent pools are respected — no cross-team peeking.
- If you’ve connected your ATS to Kello, we’ll mirror the exact access controls you've already set there.

And if you're the org owner, you have full control to customize this even further.

## Pro tips for making the most of it

- Hiring for a repeat role? Start by checking applicants from the last time you hired for it.
- Trying to move fast? Use “Most Advanced Stage” to find folks who’ve already gone through interviews.
- Want to reduce sourcing load? Build a Collection of warm candidates to prioritize outreach.
- Have a team of sourcers? Use the “Sourced By” filter to resurface your past outreach winners.

## One small step for hiring teams, one giant leap for candidate rediscovery

The Talent Pool is your hidden superpower. It turns your hiring history into a strategic advantage — helping you move faster, reach out smarter, and make use of all the signal your team has already gathered.

Give it a spin next time you open a new role. Your future self (and your hiring manager) will thank you.

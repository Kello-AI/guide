Pipelines stall, sources dry up, and candidate quality can feel like a mystery. That’s why we built Job Analytics right into every job on Kello. 

We split insights into four big buckets—each answering a specific question your team is probably already asking:

## 1. Pipeline Health & Velocity

**Recruiter question:** _"How is the pipeline moving right now?"_

These charts give you a quick pulse check on how candidates are progressing through your funnel. Useful for spotting bottlenecks early, balancing recruiter workload, and pacing hiring timelines.

### Pass-through rate

Shows % of candidates moving from one stage to the next. If 200 applied, but only 10 made it to interviews... you might have a filtering problem (or a sourcing one).

### Time between stages

Highlights how long candidates are stuck at each stage. Are recruiters responding quickly? Are interviewers delaying next steps? This chart helps identify and resolve those slowdowns.

### Current volume by stage

Gives a snapshot of how many candidates are sitting in each stage right now. Helps with workload balancing (e.g., one recruiter might be overloaded with screening calls).

## 2. Best Performing Channels

**Recruiter question:** _"Which channels are feeding the funnel and how far do they go?"_

Not all sources are created equal. This section helps you track both volume **and** yield by source — so you can double down on what works.

### Application volume by source (time-series)

Tracks how many candidates are coming in from each source (e.g., LinkedIn, referrals, agency) over time. Great for spotting trends and seasonal spikes.

### Application to Interview Funnel by Source

Shows how far candidates from each source go in your process. That Twitter post might bring in 100 applicants, but if none get interviews... is it worth it?

## 3. Who's Applying: Candidate Composition

**Recruiter question:** _"Who are we attracting?"_

This section helps answer: _"Are we attracting the type of talent this role (and company) really needs?"_ Use it to:

- Check if your outreach or brand is resonating with your target talent pool
- Find gaps between your ideal candidate profile and the real applicant pool
- Help hiring managers calibrate expectations based on reality

### By Industry

Which industries are our applicants coming from? Helps determine if they bring domain knowledge or transferable expertise.

### By Company Size

What is the size of companies they previously worked at? Useful to match candidates to the scale of your current team (e.g., startup generalists vs. enterprise specialists).

### Years of Experience

How experienced are the people applying? Quickly spot if you’re attracting junior, mid, or senior talent. If your mid-level IC role is pulling mostly interns, that’s a signal to tweak outreach or JD tone.

### By Location

Where are our candidates based? Crucial for remote eligibility, time zone overlap, or future relocation planning.

### By Company Stage

Where have candidates worked before – early stage, growth, or mature orgs? Candidates from startups might bring scrappiness; those from big tech could bring scale and structure.

### By Target Company List

Compare applicants against your "dream company" list. How many come from high-caliber environments you respect?

## 4. Candidate Quality Signals

**Recruiter question:** _"How well do applicants match what we need?"_

Surface-level profiles don’t tell the full story. These charts help you zoom in on candidate quality: do they have the right skills, depth, and signals of performance?

### Required skills coverage

See what % of applicants match the top skills listed in your JD. Helpful for refining JD language or changing outreach targets.

### Average tenure distribution

A proxy for stability and commitment. If most applicants have sub-1-year stints, that’s a red flag (or just a signal to probe more).

### By College Tier

See education pedigree breakdown. Use it sparingly—this is directional, not a hiring proxy.

### Multiple promotions rate

Signals growth trajectory. Applicants with 2\+ internal promotions often indicate high performance and adaptability.

## What should I do with all this?

Kello doesn’t just give you charts for the sake of it. The goal is to:

- Help recruiters prioritize (e.g., which roles need push, which stages are stuck)
- Give hiring managers visibility (without digging through messy spreadsheets)
- Spot patterns early (and course-correct)
- Improve sourcing ROI (by channel, by JD match, by speed)

No analytics degree required. Just click into any job, and it’s all there.

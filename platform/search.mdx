When you're staring at hundreds (or thousands) of resumes for a job you just posted, even the most enthusiastic recruiter starts to sweat a little. Referrals, re-applicants, old candidates from similar roles — they all pile up fast. And traditional search? Well... good luck if your perfect candidate didn’t use _that exact keyword_ in their resume.

Kello Search fixes that.

## The problem: Resume overload \+ clunky search

Let’s be honest — most keyword-based resume searches suck. You miss great candidates just because they wrote "user experience" instead of "UX." Or you spend 20 minutes crafting complex filters, only to get a flood of unqualified results.

Recruiters want to find candidates who match _real human descriptions_, not just exact words.

## The solution: Write what you want, get who you need

Kello Search lets you search your entire candidate pool — using plain language.

Just type in what you're looking for. Kello’s AI digs through every resume, application response, and job history to surface candidates who match, even if they don’t use your exact phrasing.

### Example searches:

- `Show me candidates I haven’t seen who applied since last Friday`
- `Candidates with 3 to 6 years of experience, expected CTC under 42 LPA, MBA from IIM A/B/C, currently at McKinsey or BCG, undergrad in CS or Data Science`
- `Software developers with 2 to 4 years of experience, who have worked at a Fintech startup for at least 2 years and should have worked on side projects. Should be well versed with Rust or Golang`

Yep, it’s that flexible.

## What can you search?

Pretty much everything a candidate has ever shared with you:

- Resume
- Answers to application questions
- Job history, education, skills, roles, locations
- Application metadata (when they applied, if you’ve viewed them, etc.)

You can search within:

- Applicants to a specific job
- Your full talent pool across all jobs (including past applicants)

Just choose your scope, and search away.

## What makes Kello Search different?

### ✅ AI, not keywords

We don’t just look for word matches — we look for meaning. So when you say “consultants at top-tier firms,” we understand that might mean McKinsey, BCG, Bain, or even other similar firms.

### 🧠 Smart relevance ranking

Every candidate gets a search explainer. We break down your search into individual components, and show:

- Which criteria they matched
- Which ones they didn’t
- The relevant parts of their profile so you can decide fast

Candidates are sorted by match quality, so you see the strongest fits first — not just a jumbled list.

### 💾 Save and share searches

Think of it as your recruiting superpower bookmarks.

You can **save any search** prompt to come back to later, or **share it with your team** to keep everyone aligned on what “a great fit” looks like.

Searches are reusable, editable, and lightning fast (about ~5 seconds per run).

### 🧪 Iterate fast

You’ll rarely get the perfect results on your first try. That’s expected. Kello makes it easy to tweak your search, test variations, or combine filters with freeform search.

The fast response time means you can explore your candidate pool like a pro.

## Pro tips to get the best results

- **Be descriptive, not prescriptive**: Write like you’d describe the candidate to a teammate. Example:\
  `Looking for frontend engineers with 4-6 years of experience, who’ve worked at a fast-growing startup and use React daily`
- **Use filters to narrow down**: Combine search with UI filters — for things like location, current company, or job source — to refine your pool.
- **Use “unseen candidates” to stay efficient**: Add things like `I haven’t seen` to avoid re-reviewing old profiles.
- **Save your best searches**: Especially useful for recurring roles (like SDRs or product designers) where your criteria is pretty stable.

## Limitations (we’re being honest)

- The AI is smart, but it’s not perfect. Some niche or ambiguous terms might not match as expected — we’re working on it.
- If your query is very vague (e.g., “good JavaScript devs”), the results might be too broad. More context helps.

We ship improvements biweekly, and share them in our product update emails we send to all our users. 

## Ready to try it?

Start a search from any job page or your main Talent Pool. Write out the candidate you’re imagining, hit Enter, and see who shows up. Then tweak, refine, and save the searches that work.

And if you find someone great — maybe drop us a note? We love recruiter success stories.

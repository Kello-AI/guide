Easy Apply is great for candidate volume —but creates busywork for hiring teams. So we made this bridge. It’s free. It’s unlimited. And it gives you back control (and time).

## What this integration does

Our Chrome extension connects your LinkedIn Easy Apply jobs directly to Kello. One click, and we:

- Create a synced copy of your LinkedIn job in Kello.
- Pull in all Easy Apply applicants—automatically and continuously.
- Auto-categorize them based on LinkedIn’s fit suggestions:
  - 👍 Good fit → Advanced
  - 🤔 Maybe → Pending Review
  - ❌ Not a fit → Archived
- Let you manage your pipeline in Kello with all the usual goodness:
  - Powerful filters
  - Collaborative review
  - AI-powered resume search
  - Fast shortlisting

No more downloading resumes one by one. No more tab juggling. Just a clean, usable pipeline.

## How to enable it

It takes less than a minute:

1. Install the Chrome extension: [Install it from here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/send-linkedin-easy-apply/plkhjpganneodbncohofnbpdlcgplhib?hl=en-GB&authuser=0)
2. Log in or sign up at [kello.ai](http://kello.ai/app)

4. Click the new “Sync to Kello” button on the page
5. Done. We'll keep syncing candidates in the background as they apply.

That’s it. You don’t even need to keep the LinkedIn tab open — just keep your browser running.

🔒 We only sync what you explicitly choose. No background spying. No surprise data grabs.

## Make the most of it

Once your candidates are in Kello, this is where things really start working in your favor:

### **Invite your hiring team (yes, including that hiring manager)**

No more forwarding resumes or taking screenshots of profiles. Just invite teammates to the job in Kello, so everyone can review, comment, and move candidates forward—together. It’s faster, more transparent, and no one gets left out of the loop

### **Use recruitment stages to organize your pipeline**

Use Kello defined stages or define your own stages—like “Phone screen”, “Hiring manager review”, or “On-site scheduled”—and drag candidates through as they move forward (or fall out). You'll never lose track of where someone is in the process. 

### **Filter, search, and analytics**

Use Smart Filters to instantly slice your pipeline by skills, experience, tags, location, or anything else that matters. Need something specific? Kello Search understands natural language and searches across resumes, notes, and candidate profiles.\
And when it’s time to report out? Kello Analytics gives you real-time insights on application volume, source quality, and stage conversions.

All of this, synced from one Easy Apply job. Like turning a pile of resumes into a structured, collaborative workflow—with superpowers.

## Limitations (just so you know)

- Only works on Chrome (for now).
- Syncing runs through your browser, so keep Chrome open (you can close the tab though).
- Only works on jobs you have access to as the recruiter/poster on LinkedIn.
- Doesn’t work with InMail or Recruiter Messaging pipelines—only Easy Apply jobs.

## What this integration does

Our Chrome extension connects your LinkedIn Easy Apply jobs directly to Kello. One click, and we:

- Create a synced copy of your LinkedIn job in Kello.
- Pull in all Easy Apply applicants—automatically and continuously.
- Auto-categorize them based on LinkedIn’s fit suggestions:
  - 👍 Good fit → Advanced
  - 🤔 Maybe → Pending Review
  - ❌ Not a fit → Archived
- Let you manage your pipeline in Kello with all the usual goodness:
  - Powerful filters
  - Collaborative review
  - AI-powered resume search
  - Fast shortlisting

No more downloading resumes one by one. No more tab juggling. Just a clean, usable pipeline.

## How to enable it

It takes less than a minute:

1. Install the Chrome extension: Install it here
2. Log in or sign up at [kello.ai](http://kello.ai)
3. Go to LinkedIn and open a job post you own (with Easy Apply enabled)
4. Click the new “Sync to Kello” button on the page
5. Done. We'll keep syncing candidates in the background as they apply.

That’s it. You don’t even need to keep the LinkedIn tab open — just keep your browser running.

🔒 We only sync what you explicitly choose. No background spying. No surprise data grabs.

### Security & Data Ownership

- **Secure by design**: We use industry-standard encryption (TLS & at‑rest) and OAuth 2.0 with least-privilege scopes to ensure your data is protected in transit and at rest.
- **You maintain control**: You own all candidate data imported into Kello. You can revoke access anytime, and we’ll stop syncing—plus, you can export everything in standard formats.
- **Shared responsibility**: We secure infrastructure, audits, and compliance; you manage access (e.g. passwords, revoke permissions) for your team

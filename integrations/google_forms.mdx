### What the integration lets you do

Once connected, the Google Forms integration turns a basic spreadsheet of job applications into a powerful, searchable, and structured hiring workflow — all inside Kello.

Here’s everything it unlocks:

#### 🔄 Syncs all your applicants — past and future

As soon as you select the Google Forms used for hiring, Kello pulls in:

- Everyone who already applied via those forms
- Any new submissions going forward, automatically

#### 🧠 Cleans up and structures messy data

You don’t have to worry about inconsistent answers anymore. Kello automatically parses and normalizes common fields like: Notice period, CTC, Location, Work experience.

> This means you can filter applicants cleanly — even if they typed things in different ways.

#### 📄 Fully indexes resumes

Whether the resume was uploaded as a file or shared via a Google Drive link, Kello parses it and makes the entire content searchable and filterable. You can:

- Filter by skills or technologies
- Search for specific past roles or experience
- Surface candidates who match your job description closely\
  Basically, you get all of Kello’s seach and filtering intelligence — right out of your Forms.

#### 💬 Makes open-text answers actually usable

Asked candidates why they want to join your team? Or what motivates them?\
Kello makes those answers searchable too. You can type in things like:

- “Looking for candidates who care about our mission”
- “Show me people excited about our culture”

#### 🧩 Works with your ATS (if connected)

If you’ve linked your ATS (like Lever or Greenhouse), candidates from Google Forms can flow right into your existing system — fully enriched and ready to move forward.

#### 🧾 Keeps your form questions intact

All custom form questions are imported into Kello — not just resume uploads. You can:

- Filter by answers (e.g. “Available to join immediately”)
- Use them as fields in search
- See them right in the candidate profile — no digging required

### Make the most of it

Here are some quick tips to get extra mileage out of this setup:

- **Add a resume upload question**\
  Google Forms supports file uploads — just make sure you collect resumes so we can parse and analyze them.
- **Use short-answer questions for filters**\
  Kello treats these as structured fields you can search and filter by.
- **Label your Forms clearly**\
  Helps avoid confusion when syncing multiple roles.
- **Use it with Kello Search & Filters**\
  Combine this with Kello’s natural language search and filtering to surface candidates worth interviewing and take control of your pipeline.

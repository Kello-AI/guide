## First, Let‚Äôs Talk About Trust

We know what you‚Äôre thinking:

> _‚ÄúWait. You want access to my Gmail inbox?‚Äù_

Totally fair. Here‚Äôs what you need to know‚Äîright up front.

### ‚úÖ We do **not** read your whole inbox.

We don‚Äôt browse through your emails. We use **Gmail‚Äôs official API** to apply **very specific filters** that only look for messages likely to be job applications. Everything else is ignored.

### üîç We only scan for candidate emails.

Specifically:

- Emails from @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, or academic domains like `*.ac.in`
- Messages with resumes attached (.pdf or .docx)
- Emails containing phrases like ‚Äúapplying for the position‚Äù or ‚Äúattached my resume‚Äù

No newsletters, no personal email, no sales spam.

### üîê We only ask for **read-only access**.

We don‚Äôt modify, label, delete, or send emails. Your inbox stays exactly the way you left it.

### üëã You can disconnect anytime.

You‚Äôre always in control. Revoke access or delete your data from Kello‚Äîwhenever you want, no questions asked.

### ‚úÖ We‚Äôre Google Verified.

Kello has passed **Google‚Äôs CASA Tier 2 security audit**‚Äîthe most in-depth security and privacy assessment Google requires for apps that access Gmail. We did the work to earn your trust.

Now that we‚Äôve got that out of the way, let‚Äôs explain **why** we built this and **how it helps.**

## Why This Exists: Inbox Chaos for Hiring Teams

If you‚Äôve ever posted a job online, you know what happens next:\
Your inbox gets swarmed.

- Cold emails from interested candidates
- Resumes from friends-of-friends
- Referrals sent by coworkers
- Random applications from alumni networks

Some even skip the job portal entirely and go straight to your inbox‚Äîespecially if you or your team dropped an email address in the job post (oops).

The result?\
A messy inbox, siloed candidates, and team members forwarding resumes like it's 2009.

## What This Integration Does

We built a Gmail integration that automatically scans your inbox for job applicants, extracts their profiles, and pipes them into your Kello talent pool.

Think of it as a helpful recruiter who sifts through your email and adds legit candidates to your pipeline‚Äîwithout reading anything else.

### What It Does:

- Finds emails that **are definitely job applications**
- Parses resumes from **PDFs, DOCX**, or plain text
- Adds qualified candidates directly to your **Kello Talent Pool**
- Keeps them private or shareable‚Äîwith your choice of visibility

## Full Control Over Who Sees What

Once a candidate is pulled in from your inbox, they‚Äôll show up in your **Talent Pool** on Kello.\
From there, you can:

- Keep them **private to just you**
- Share with a **select group of teammates**
- Or make them visible to your **entire hiring org**

No messy forwards or Slack threads required.

## Got Questions? Feedback? Paranoia?

Totally fair. If you want to talk through how this works before enabling it, just ping us from the chat bubble inside Kello or email `security@kello.ai`.

Ready when you are :)

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does Kello read my entire inbox?" icon="sparkles">
    No. We never read your full inbox. Kello uses Gmail‚Äôs official API to apply very specific filters that only target potential job application emails. Everything else is ignored.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I see what Kello will scan before I connect Gmail?" icon="sparkles">
    Yes. We offer a Gmail link with **pre-applied filters **before you give access, so you can preview the exact emails Kello would access. No surprises.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What kind of access does Kello have to my Gmail?">
    Kello has **read-only access**.\
    We don‚Äôt write, send, delete, or label anything in your inbox. Your emails stay exactly how they are.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does Kello store my emails or attachments?">
    Only candidate emails that match our filters are parsed and stored in your Kello talent pool. We do not store your full inbox, or any unrelated emails or metadata.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I change my mind? Can I disconnect Gmail?">
    Absolutely. You can revoke Gmail access at any time from your [**Google Account permissions**](https://myaccount.google.com/connections?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmyaccount.google.com%2Fdata-and-privacy) or within Kello‚Äôs **Integrations settings**.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is this integration verified by Google?">
    Yes. Kello has passed **Google‚Äôs CASA Tier 2 security audit**‚Äîa comprehensive review of how we handle Gmail data, including security practices, infrastructure, and privacy policies. It‚Äôs the highest level of scrutiny Google requires for Gmail-based apps.

    It‚Äôs very rare, but possible. If a personal email mimics the structure of a job application (e.g., resume attached, relevant phrases) and has a resume attached in the email, Kello may parse it. You can delete or hide any such records in Kello‚Äîand let us know if you'd like to refine your filter.

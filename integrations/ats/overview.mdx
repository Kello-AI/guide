## Why Connect Your ATS?

Your ATS holds years of hiring history — candidates you’ve sourced, screened, interviewed, and often... forgotten. Connecting it to Kello helps you tap into that valuable data instead of starting from scratch every time.

Here’s what it unlocks:

- **Rediscover qualified candidates**\
  Search across previous applicants, interview notes, and outcomes to find people who’ve already engaged with your team — and might be a perfect fit now.

- **Search smarter, not harder**\
  Use Kello’s filters and natural language search to cut through the noise and find exactly who you’re looking for — across open, closed, and archived jobs.

- **No duplicate effort**\
  All jobs, candidates, stages, feedback, and notes stay in sync across both systems. Changes made in Kello are pushed back to the ATS automatically.
- **Keep your existing permissions**\
  Kello mirrors your ATS access controls, so there’s nothing new to configure — and no risk of exposing the wrong data.
- **Power up your workflows**\
  Connect Gmail, Google Forms, or LinkedIn Easy Apply — and push those candidates directly into your ATS with Kello in the middle. In short, Kello can act as a connector.
- **Unlock analytics that matter**\
  ATS data fuels Kello’s insights — helping you track hiring velocity, source quality, and pipeline performance across roles and time.

Bottom line: your ATS is where the data lives. Kello is where it starts working for you.

### Security & Permissions

We mirror the exact user access and permissions from Lever.\
Kello doesn’t override or add permissions — so everything falls under your existing ATS governance.

That means zero extra admin overhead and consistent control across both platforms.

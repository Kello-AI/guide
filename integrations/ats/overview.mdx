## Why Connect Your ATS?

Let’s be honest — your ATS is probably the biggest **graveyard of great candidates**.

People who made it to final rounds. Folks who impressed, but just weren’t the right fit _then_. With every new job opening, those candidates sit there — buried under years of hiring history.

Connecting your ATS to Kello brings them back into the light.

Here’s what it unlocks:

- **Your historical data actually works for you.**\
  Instantly search across past applicants, interview feedback, hiring stages — and resurface promising profiles for new roles.
- **No context lost, no duplication.**\
  Jobs, candidates, feedback, and notes sync automatically. What happens in Kello is reflected back in your ATS — and vice versa.
- **Stay aligned with how your org already works.**\
  We copy over access controls and user roles exactly as they are in your ATS. You don’t need to manage permissions in two places.
- **Other integrations get smarter too.**\
  Whether it’s Google Forms, Gmail, or LinkedIn Easy Apply, candidate data from those channels can now flow into your ATS — through Kello.
- **It powers up your analytics that actually matter.**\
  Want to see how fast your pipeline is moving, or which sources actually work? You’ll need ATS data for that — and Kello makes it visible.

Bottom line? Your ATS is the system of record. But Kello turns it into a system of action.

### Security & Permissions

We mirror the exact user access and permissions from Lever.\
Kello doesn’t override or add permissions — so everything falls under your existing ATS governance.

That means zero extra admin overhead and consistent control across both platforms.
